# AutoRefinedInstaller

This is a script to automatically install TopazTK's Re:Fined mod to a game of Kingdom hearts 1, Kingdom Hearts 2, and Kingdom hearts BBS. (This does not install the Refined mod for Dream Drop at this time.)

This also automatically installs the Offline Patch for the game. 

### Intructions
 
 1.Download the Script
 
 2.Run the script.
 
 3.Confirm if it found your game's install location (It should)
 
 4.Select what games you would like to install KH refined for. Do one at a time, type "done" when finished.
 
 5.Confirm if you would like the Offline patch.
 
 6.Confirm if you are using Proton or Proton GE to run Kingdom hearts (You want to select Wine unless you know what your doing.)
 
 7.Set the game to use the new wineprefix in your home directory. This will be /home/(username)/RefinedPrefix (Username is "deck" on the steamdeck).
 
 7.Launch the game.
 
 
 
 
### Dependencies: (both pre-installed on the steam deck)
  
  1.Winetricks
  
  2.Curl
  
  
  
### Notes:

A wineprefix will be generated in your hoime directory in a folder called RefinedPrefix. Do not delete this folder. 

This script is compatible with the steam deck, however you much run it through Lutris's terminal.
